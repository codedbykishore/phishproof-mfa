**Current Status: 6/10 completed**

**Prerequisites**: Phase 3.6 completion, all current tests passing

### Issue Details for Phase 4.1:

#### T061: Welcome Message White Text Issue
- **Problem**: Welcome message is not displaying in white color as requested
- **Investigation**: Search ALL frontend files (not just CSS) - check src/frontend/index.html, src/frontend/js/app.js, src/frontend/css/styles.css
- **Root Cause**: Need to identify if it's CSS specificity, inline styles, or JavaScript overriding the color

#### T062: Audit Log Event Types
- **Problem**: Audit log shows "unknown event" instead of descriptive event names
- **Fix**: Update audit logging in src/backend/routes.js to use proper event types:
  - "login" for authentication events
  - "transaction" for money transfers
  - "logout" for session termination
  - "registration" for new user signup
  - "balance_check" for dashboard views

#### T063: Logout Cancellation Redirect
- **Problem**: After clicking cancel on logout confirmation, user sees empty page
- **Fix**: Modify logout cancellation handler in src/frontend/js/app.js to redirect back to dashboard tab

#### T064: Balance Display Enhancement
- **Problem**: Balance shows in dollars ($) instead of rupees (₹)
- **Requirements**: 
  - Change currency symbol to ₹ (Indian Rupee)
  - Make balance text green color
  - Increase font size for better visibility
  - Beautify the wallet/balance display section

#### T065: Empty Button Bug
- **Problem**: Login and signup buttons sometimes appear empty/blank
- **Investigation**: Debug intermittent rendering issue - check for:
  - JavaScript timing issues
  - CSS loading problems
  - Event listener conflicts
  - State management issues

#### T066: User-to-User Transfer System
- **Problem**: No transfer functionality between users
- **Security Requirements**:
  - NO user dropdown (security risk)
  - Recipient must enter exact username manually
  - Only transfer if recipient username exists
  - Validate sufficient balance before transfer
- **Implementation**: New transfer endpoint + frontend form

#### T067: Last Login Tracking
- **Problem**: Last login timestamp not registering/fetching correctly from database
- **Investigation**: Check both database write (on login) and read (on dashboard display)
- **Files**: src/backend/database.js for queries, src/backend/routes.js for login handling

#### T068: Transaction History for Transfers
- **Problem**: When implementing user-to-user transfers, recent transactions must update properly
- **Requirements**:
  - Sender sees: "Transfer to [username]: -₹[amount]"
  - Recipient sees: "Received from [username]: +₹[amount]"
  - Both transactions appear in respective recent transaction lists

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Load plan.md from feature directory
   → If not found: ERROR "No implementation plan found"
   → Extract: tech stack, libraries, structure
2. Load optional design documents:
   → data-model.md: Extract entities → model tasks
   → contracts/: Each file → contract test task
   → research.md: Extract decisions → setup tasks
3. Generate tasks by category:
   → Setup: project init, dependencies, linting
   → Tests: contract tests, integration tests
   → Core: models, services, CLI commands
   → Integration: DB, middleware, logging
   → Polish: unit tests, performance, docs
4. Apply task rules:
   → Different files = mark [P] for parallel
   → Same file = sequential (no [P])
   → Tests before implementation (TDD)
5. Number tasks sequentially (T001, T002...)
6. Generate dependency graph
7. Create parallel execution examples
8. Validate task completeness:
   → All contracts have tests?
   → All entities have models?
   → All endpoints implemented?
9. Return: SUCCESS (tasks ready for execution)
```

## Dependencies
- Setup (T001-T006) before everything
- Tests (T007-T014) before implementation (T015-T041)
- Database models (T015-T017) before API routes (T020-T026)
- Backend routes (T020-T026) before frontend implementation (T027-T036)
- Core implementation (T015-T036) before integration (T037-T041)
- Everything before polish (T042-T050)

## Parallel Example
```
# Launch T007-T014 together (all contract and integration tests):
Task: "Contract test for WebAuthn registration endpoints in tests/contract/test-webauthn-registration.js"
Task: "Contract test for WebAuthn authentication endpoints in tests/contract/test-webauthn-authentication.js"
Task: "Contract test for dashboard and transfer endpoints in tests/contract/test-dashboard-transfers.js"
Task: "Integration test for passkey registration flow in tests/integration/test-passkey-registration.js"
Task: "Integration test for passkey authentication flow in tests/integration/test-passkey-login.js"
Task: "Integration test for dashboard display in tests/integration/test-dashboard-display.js"
Task: "Integration test for transfer operations in tests/integration/test-transfer-operation.js"
Task: "Integration test for audit logging in tests/integration/test-audit-logging.js"
```

## Notes
- [P] tasks = different files, no dependencies
- Verify tests fail before implementing (TDD requirement)
- Commit after each task completion
- Database operations in routes.js are sequential due to shared file
- Frontend components can be parallel as they modify different sections of app.js
- All tasks include exact file paths for clarity

## Task Generation Rules
*Applied during main() execution*

1. **From Contracts**:
   - Each contract file → contract test task [P] (3 contract test tasks)
   - Each endpoint group → implementation task (6 endpoint implementation tasks)

2. **From Data Model**:
   - Each entity → database model task [P] (3 model tasks)
   - Database schema → initialization task

3. **From User Stories**:
   - Each acceptance scenario → integration test [P] (5 integration test tasks)
   - Quickstart scenarios → validation tasks

4. **From Research**:
   - Technology decisions → setup and dependency tasks (6 setup tasks)

5. **Ordering**:
   - Setup → Tests → Database Models → API Routes → Frontend → Integration → Polish
   - Dependencies block parallel execution where files overlap

## Validation Checklist
*GATE: Checked by main() before returning*

- [x] All contracts have corresponding tests (3 contract test tasks)
- [x] All entities have model tasks (3 database model tasks)
- [x] All tests come before implementation (TDD ordering maintained)
- [x] Parallel tasks truly independent (different files or non-conflicting sections)
- [x] Each task specifies exact file path (all tasks include paths)
- [x] No task modifies same file as another [P] task (verified file separation)</content>
