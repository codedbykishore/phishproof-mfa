# Feature Specification: Build a Minimal Banking Prototype with Phishing-Resistant MFA

**Feature Branch**: `001-build-a-minimal`  
**Created**: 2025-09-26  
**Updated**: 2025-09-27  
**Status**: Updated  
**Input**: **Input**: User description: "Build a minimal banking prototype focused **on phishing-resistant MFA (WebAuthn/Passkey) with password fallback**.

1. **App type:** Single-page app (SPA) — all interactions happen on one page with sections or tabs for Login/Register, Dashboard, Transactions, and Audit/Logs.  
2. **Authentication (core):**  
   - **Hybrid Authentication**: WebAuthn/Passkey as primary + password as fallback/secondary factor  
   - **MFA Definition**: Combined approach provides multi-factor authentication through:  
     - **Something you have** (authenticator device/hardware)  
     - **Something you are** (biometric/PIN verification)  
     - **Something you know** (password + credential possession)  
   - Store public keys and passwords server-side (SQLite database for prototype).  
3. **Post-Registration Flow:** After successful WebAuthn registration, redirect to login page (not dashboard)  
4. **Dashboard:** Show fake account holder, balance (e.g., ₹5,000), and recent transactions (client-side state).  
5. **Make Transfer:** Simple form that updates client-side balance and appends a transaction row.  
6. **Audit/Log panel:** Record timestamped events for registration, login successes/failures, and transfer operations.  
7. **Visual cues:** Clear success/failure indicators (green for successful auth/transfers, red for failed operations) with short tooltips.  
8. **Hosting:** Hostable on Vercel/Netlify (frontend) + Node/Express server with SQLite to handle authentication and data storage.  
9. **Security note (prototype):** No real money, local SQLite storage OK, do not expose private keys or real credentials.  
10. **Deliverables:** Hosted demo URL, GitHub repo with README (run steps + short demo script), and description of the security benefits.

## Clarifications

### Session 2025-09-26
- Q: How should users be uniquely identified in the system? → A: Device-based (WebAuthn credential ID serves as identifier)
- Q: What is the session timeout duration after successful WebAuthn authentication? → A: 30 minutes
- Q: Should rate limiting be implemented for authentication attempts? → A: No rate limiting needed for prototype
- Q: What are the performance targets for WebAuthn operations? → A: <=1 second
- Q: How long should audit events be retained in the system? → A: 24 hours for prototype demonstration

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   → If empty: ERROR "No feature description provided"
2. Extract key concepts from description
   → Identify: actors, actions, data, constraints
3. For each unclear aspect:
   → Mark with [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question]
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   → If no clear user flow: ERROR "Cannot determine user scenarios"
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   → Each requirement must be testable
   → Mark ambiguous requirements
6. Identify Key Entities (if data involved)
7. Run Review Checklist
   → If any [NEEDS CLARIFICATION]: WARN "Spec has uncertainties"
   → If implementation details found: ERROR "Remove tech details"
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## ⚡ Quick Guidelines
- ✅ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ❌ Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- 👥 Written for business stakeholders, not developers

### Section Requirements
- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature
- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature
- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as "N/A")

### For AI Generation
When creating this spec from a user prompt:
1. **Mark all ambiguities**: Use [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question] for any assumption you'd need to make
2. **Don't guess**: If the prompt doesn't specify something (e.g., "login system" without auth method), mark it
3. **Think like a tester**: Every vague requirement should fail the "testable and unambiguous" checklist item
4. **Common underspecified areas**:
   - User types and permissions
   - Data retention/deletion policies  
   - Performance targets and scale
   - Error handling behaviors
   - Integration requirements
   - Security/compliance needs

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
As a bank customer, I want to securely access my personalized account using phishing-resistant authentication with enhanced security features so that I can view my balance, make both basic and user-to-user transfers, and monitor comprehensive audit logs with multiple layers of security protection.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** a new user visits the banking app, **When** they register with username/password and WebAuthn credential, **Then** they are redirected to login page
2. **Given** a registered user visits the login page, **When** they enter username/password and complete WebAuthn authentication, **Then** they see personalized dashboard with welcome message
3. **Given** an authenticated user is on their dashboard, **When** they make a basic transfer, **Then** their balance updates and a transaction record appears
4. **Given** an authenticated user wants to send money to another user, **When** they search for recipient and initiate transfer, **Then** system requires WebAuthn confirmation for high-value transfers
5. **Given** any user interaction occurs, **When** authentication or operations succeed/fail, **Then** clear visual indicators show results with comprehensive audit entries
6. **Given** a user hovers over logout button, **When** the red warning appears, **Then** they see security reminder about proper session termination
7. **Given** a user accesses audit logs, **When** they apply filters or search, **Then** they can find specific events and transaction details

### Edge Cases
- What happens when WebAuthn registration fails due to device limitations?
- How does system handle multiple failed authentication attempts? (Note: No rate limiting implemented for prototype)
- What happens when user tries to make a transfer without sufficient balance?
- How does system behave when WebAuthn credential becomes invalid?
- What happens when user session expires after 30 minutes?
- How does user-to-user transfer handle non-existent recipient usernames?
- What happens when user cancels WebAuthn confirmation during transfer?
- How does system handle audit log search with no matching results?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*
